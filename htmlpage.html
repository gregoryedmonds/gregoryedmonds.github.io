                <p>
                    HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language and was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee to be
                    released in 1993. At its core, HTML can be seen as the main structure of a web page. Each page
                    contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page on the internet is
                    written using some type of HTML code.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Mid 1993 - HTML 1.0</h2>
                    <li>This was the original version of HTML. It had very limited features and was greatly limited in
                        what you could do to design web pages.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>November 1995 - HTML 2.0</h2>
                    <li>HTML 2.0 arrived and included all the features of HTML 1.0 alongside several new features. For a
                        couple years until 1997, HTML 2.0 was the standard in web page design.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>March 1995 - HTML 3.0 (Proposal)</h2>
                    <li>HTML 2.0 successfully achieved what it set out to do, but many people designing websites at the
                        time wanted more control over their web pages and more ways to enhance their text and overall
                        appearance of their websites. </li>
                    <li>At around the same time, an HTML working group led by Dave Raggett introduced a draft of HTML
                        3.0, which included many new and useful enhancements to HTML 2.0. Most browsers, however, only
                        implemented a few features of this draft. More confusion arose as people, more often than not,
                        referred to documents containing browser specific tags instead of referring to documents
                        adhering to the HTML 3.0 draft. This was a major reason why the draft was later abandoned.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>January 1997 - HTML 3.2</h2>
                    <li>After the introduction of more browser-specific tags it became obvious that a new standard was
                        needed. Because of this, the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which was founded in 1994 to
                        develop standards for the evolution of web, drafted the WILBUR standard. This later became known
                        as HTML 3.2. It can be seen as the standardised version of HTML 3.0 and most popular browsers
                        today fully support its use.</li>
                    <li>Another important feature of HTML 3.2 was support for <a href="csspage.html"> CSS (Cascading
                            Style Sheets).</a></li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>December 1997 - HTML 4.0</h2>
                    <li>This version of HTML introduced new functionality, most of which came from the expired HTML 3.0
                        draft. HTML 4.0 became a recommendation for developers in December, 1997 and then a standard as
                        of April, 1998.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>October 2014 - HTML5</h2>
                    <li>HTML 5 (typically written as HTML5) is the latest web standard following HTML 4 and XHTML. Since
                        HTML 4.0 was introduced back in 1997, much has changed with the web and something needed to be
                        done to address all the new technologies and latest media. HTML5 is the result of a combined
                        effort that began in 2006 between the W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
                        Group (WHATWG). Its basic aims are to improve the language and to support the latest multimedia.
                        In
                        order to accomplish this, some ground rules were established by the two cooperating
                        organisations, such as reducing the need for external plug-ins like Flash, better handling of
                        errors, and more markup elements to replace scripting. As well as this, a large selection of new
                        application program interfaces (APIs) lets developers easily integrate a huge range of
                        functionality into HTML5 sites. One big advantage of HTML5 is that it doesn’t rely on
                        proprietary third-party plugins to create complex and powerful web projects.</li>
                    <li>Some new features of HTML5 include special elements for semantic labelling such as tags for
                        sections, navigation, headers, footers and main sections (which are all used in this website).
                        These elements define the type of content associated with each element, making structuring
                        content more efficient and helping search engines to navigate through websites. This means that
                        a well-structured HTML5 site has better chances of ranking highly in search results.</li>
                    <li>Adding multimedia elements is also simplified in HTML5 through the use of audio and video tags.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                        each tag. These elements have been present in HTML since it was created with some updates for
                        HTML5.

                        <li>The &lt;ol&gt; tag denotes the start of an ordered (numbered) list. Each &lt;li&gt; tag then

                        <li>
                            The &lt;a&gt; tag (anchor tag) denotes a link. In this case to an external website.

                            - The 'alt' attribute specifies the text to show in place of the image in case the image
