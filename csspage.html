                    CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets and was first conceptualised by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, then
                    made a specification by the W3C in 1996. CSS is a language used to describe reusable styles for
                    presenting documents written in a markup language. It allows web developers to alter the layout and
                    appearance of their web pages.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>December 1996 – CSS 1</h2>
                    <li>The internet’s first official introduction to CSS was back in 1996 when W3C released it into the
                        world. CSS was not the only styling language in development at the time, but the very element of
                        cascading and developing sequences is what set it apart from the rest.</li>
                    <li>The addition of CSS allowed for web elements to adopt unique characteristics. The major benefit
                        was that designers and developers now had the ability to change properties of CSS without having
                        to change the html.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>May 1998 – CSS 2</h2>
                    <li>Wanting to build on the properties of CSS, the first working draft of CSS 2 was released in
                        November 1997 and became a W3C recommendation in May 1998.</li>
                    <li>This version expanded the capabilities of properties which allowed them to be more featured. The
                        use of the infamous text-shadow effect is an example of this.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>June 2011 – CSS 2.1</h2>
                    <li>CSS 2.1 was first introduced in 2004 and became a W3C Recommendation in June 2011. This revised
                        version solved much of the bugs that were apparent CSS 2 and became its replacement.</li>
                    <li>It allowed the definition of parent-child relationships and gave designers and developers the
                        ability to define multiple class names on a given element. It also introduced the ability to
                        adjust font size, which would go on to perhaps be the first taste of responsive design.</li>
                    <li>Presentations could now be tailored to specific media devices such as phones, printers and even
                        braille and aural devices. This was the beginning of what would become CSS 3.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>June 1999 – CSS 3</h2>
                    <li>Work on CSS 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. It
                        builds on older versions of CSS.</li>
                    <li>Instead of defining all features in a single and large specification like CSS 2, CSS 3 is
                        divided into several separate documents called modules. Each module adds new capability or
                        extends features defined in CSS 2.</li>
                    <li>As of March 2011, there are over 40 CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group. Some of
                        these include electors, namespaces, colour and media queries.</li>
                    <br>
                    <h2>CSS 4?</h2>
                    <li>Because CSS 3 was separated into modules, there will be no single CSS 4 release. Some level 4
                        modules which build on level 3 functions have released, and new functionality has been added
                        into modules. These modules will continue to be released to continue to add and update features
                        of CSS 3.</li>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>A single CSS file may be linked to one or multiple HTML pages, which allows a developer to change
                        the
                        appearance
                        of all the pages at the same time.</p>
                    <br>
                    Some common uses of CSS are to
                    <li>Specify a background colour for a webpage, a table, a form element, or a paragraph.</li>
                    <li>Specify a common style for one tag or a set of tags.</li>
                    <li>Specify the distance between elements.</li>
                    <li>Specify the appearance of links.</li>
                    <li>Specify multiple styles for various webpages.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Looking back at or basic HTML page, we can add some of these features to it using the code below.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <!--Container for text box for code-->
                    <div class="boxed">

                        <!--Code inside text box-->
                        <pre>
body {
background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
color: red;
text-align: center;
}

h2 {
color: purple;
}

p {
font-family: verdana;
font-size: 20px;
}

ol:hover {
    background-color: blue;
  }
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <!--Button to be taken to CSS example page-->
                    <div id="buttonContainer">
                        <a href="./example_pages/cssexample.html"><button id="cssButton">View this webpage
                            </button></a>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The 'background-color' atrribute in the body{} section changes the background colour of the
                            page to light blue.</li>
                        <li>The 'color' and 'text-align' attributes in the h1{} and h2{} sections change the text colour
                            and
                            aligment for those headings only.</li>
                        <li>The 'font-family' and 'font-size' atrributes in the p{} section change the font and size for
                            the text in Paragraph only.</li>
                        <li>The ':hover' attrubute is a psuedo-class.</li>
                        - A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the
                        selected element(s).
                        <br>
                        - In this example, '':hover' is used to change the list's colour when the
                        user's pointer hovers over it. To do this, 'ol:hover' must be used.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
